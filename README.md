This is a sample application for demonstrating how to build mono-repo applications using [Nx](https://nx.dev/).

## Demo

A demo of this application is hosted [here](https://nx-nextjs-monorepo.vercel.app/).

## Requirements

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
3. [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
